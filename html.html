    <h2>Biography</h2>
    <span class="ps"></span>
    <p class="text">Welcome to my world of adventures. I have spent decades in the Network Software Development world as
      an Architect, Technical Leader, and Engineer.​ When you pick up your phone and dial a friend or family member, I
      am confident you use my code somehow. As an early architect of some of the world’s largest VOIP stacks, my work is
      utilized globally. When you open the Azure portal to create or delete resources, you use the software I made. Even
      when you fly with the biggest airlines in the USA, and use the in-flight wifi, you use my software. I love
      building networking software, that lights up the busiest infrastructures of the world. I thrive on cutting-edge
      projects and developing products used by billions worldwide. Collaborating with non-profits to enable new
      technologies is a passion of mine, with the hope that these innovations will one day make a real-world impact.
      Being surrounded by brilliant individuals who share the vision of “technology for good” inspires me. I’m humbled
      by their support and excited by the ever-growing challenges in my career, eager to take them on.</p>
